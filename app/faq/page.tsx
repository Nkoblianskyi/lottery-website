    question: "What is Oz Lotto and how does it work?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Oz Lotto is Australia's national lottery game established in 1994. It's a simple draw-style lottery where
          players select 7 numbers from 1 to 45.
        </p>
        <p>
          To win Division 1 (the jackpot), you need to match all 7 winning numbers drawn. There are also 6 other prize
          divisions for matching fewer numbers, giving you multiple chances to win.
        </p>
        <p>
          Draws take place every Tuesday at 7:30 PM AEST/AEDT. The minimum Division 1 prize pool is $2 million, but
          jackpots can grow to much larger amounts when not won.

    question: "How much does it cost to play Oz Lotto?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          A standard game of Oz Lotto costs $1.60. However, there are several ways to play that may affect the cost:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Standard entry: $1.60 per game</li>
          <li>System entry: Allows you to choose more than 7 numbers, increasing your chances but also the cost</li>
          <li>
            QuickPick: The system randomly selects numbers for you, with options ranging from 1 to 50 games per entry
          </li>
          <li>Multi-week entries: Play the same numbers for up to 10 weeks</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          For example, a 12-game QuickPick would cost $19.20 (12 Ã— $1.60), while a System 9 entry (which generates 36
          standard games) would cost $57.60.

    question: "What are the odds of winning Oz Lotto?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>The odds of winning in Oz Lotto vary by division:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Division 1 (7 numbers): 1 in 45,379,620</li>
          <li>Division 2 (6 numbers + 1 supplementary): 1 in 3,241,401</li>
          <li>Division 3 (6 numbers): 1 in 180,078</li>
          <li>Division 4 (5 numbers + 1 supplementary): 1 in 29,602</li>
          <li>Division 5 (5 numbers): 1 in 3,430</li>
          <li>Division 6 (4 numbers): 1 in 154</li>
          <li>Division 7 (3 numbers + 1 supplementary): 1 in 87</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          While Division 1 odds are challenging, the multiple prize divisions give you a better overall chance of
          winning a prize, with the overall odds being approximately 1 in 55 for any prize.

    question: "When are Oz Lotto draws held?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Oz Lotto draws are held every Tuesday at 7:30 PM AEST/AEDT. The draw is conducted at The Lott's secure draw
          facility and is supervised by independent auditors to ensure fairness.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Results are typically available within 30 minutes of the draw on our website, mobile app, and through various
          media outlets across Australia.

    question: "What happens if no one wins the Oz Lotto jackpot?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        If no one wins the Division 1 prize (jackpot) in an Oz Lotto draw, the prize money jackpots to the next draw,
        creating a larger prize pool. This process continues until someone wins Division 1 or until it reaches a
        government-regulated maximum. This jackpotting sequence is why Oz Lotto prizes can sometimes reach $50 million,
        $80 million, or even $100+ million. The jackpot will continue to climb each week until it's won, at which point
        it resets to the minimum Division 1 prize pool of $2 million and begins building again.

    question: "How do I choose my Oz Lotto numbers?",

      <div>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pick your own:</strong> Choose 7 numbers from 1 to 45 that are meaningful to you

          <li>
            <strong>QuickPick:</strong> Let the computer randomly select your numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System entries:</strong> Choose more than 7 numbers to cover more combinations
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Favourite numbers:</strong> Save your lucky numbers to play regularly
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Remember, every number combination has an equal chance of winning. Some players choose birthdays,
          anniversaries, or other significant dates, while others prefer random selections.

  {
    question: "What are System entries in Oz Lotto?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          System entries allow you to choose more than the standard 7 numbers, giving you more chances to win. Here's
          how they work:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>System 8:</strong> Choose 8 numbers, creates 8 standard games
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System 9:</strong> Choose 9 numbers, creates 36 standard games
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System 10:</strong> Choose 10 numbers, creates 120 standard games
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System 20:</strong> Choose 20 numbers, creates 77,520 standard games
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The more numbers you choose, the more combinations you cover, but the cost increases accordingly. System
          entries guarantee that if your chosen numbers include the winning numbers, you'll win multiple prizes across
          different divisions.

        <p className="mt-2">
          These massive jackpots occur when the Division 1 prize isn't won for several weeks, allowing it to jackpot and

          <strong>Good news for Oz Lotto winners:</strong> Lottery winnings are not taxed in Australia! This applies to
          all prizes from Oz Lotto and other officially sanctioned lotteries.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">However, there are some financial considerations to be aware of:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Interest earned:</strong> While the winnings themselves aren't taxed, any interest earned from
            investing your winnings is considered income and will be taxed accordingly
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gifting:</strong> If you give large amounts of your winnings to family or friends, they may be
            subject to gift taxes depending on the circumstances

        No, you must be 18 years or older to play Oz Lotto or any other lottery game in Australia. This is a legal
        requirement across all Australian states and territories. Age verification is required when creating an online
        account or purchasing tickets in-store. If you're under 18, you'll need to wait until your 18th birthday to

    question: "What are supplementary numbers in Oz Lotto?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          In each Oz Lotto draw, 7 winning numbers are drawn first, followed by 2 supplementary numbers. The
          supplementary numbers are used to determine winners in Divisions 2, 4, and 7:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Division 2:</strong> Match 6 winning numbers + 1 supplementary number
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Division 4:</strong> Match 5 winning numbers + 1 supplementary number
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Division 7:</strong> Match 3 winning numbers + 1 supplementary number
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The supplementary numbers give you additional chances to win prizes even if you don't match all the main
          winning numbers. They're drawn from the same pool of numbers (1-45) but cannot be the same as the 7 main
          winning numbers.
